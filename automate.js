 * Program : automate.js, a javascript file to automate HOpDefender functions / features
 *
 * Author : Harold H. S.
 *
 * Version : 1.0
 *
 * Usage : There are 2 classes and 2 ids for this automated tools, which are => inputSanitize, inputFilter, submitForm, HCSSForm. HTML tags that have class name 'inputSanitize'
 *         will be sanitized using HOpDefender.sanitize() before submitting the request. HTML tags that have class name 'inputFilter' will be filtered using HOpDefender.filter()
 *         before submitting the request. For submitting the request, the specific button / tag for submition use 'submitForm' for the id atrribute ( only allowed 1 submit button
 *         ). For the specific form to be sanitized / filtered, use 'HOpDefenderForm' for the id attribute.
 *
 * NOTE : This program only works for 1 form and 1 submit button in each page, but you can use inputSanitize and inputFilter more than 1
 *
